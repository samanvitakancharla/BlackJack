# Project: Vite/Tailwind Blackjack Trainer
# Rules: H17 (Hit on 17), Ace-Five Card Counting System

## Project Overview
This is a Blackjack trainer application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS that implements:
- H17 rules (dealer must hit on soft 17)
- Ace-Five card counting system for training
- Interactive blackjack gameplay with strategy guidance

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Use vanilla JavaScript with ES6+ modules
- Follow component-based architecture for game logic
- Separate concerns: game state, UI rendering, card counting logic

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Use consistent color scheme for cards and game elements

### Game Logic
- Implement accurate H17 dealer rules
- Track Ace-Five count throughout the game
- Provide real-time strategy hints based on count
- Include proper blackjack payout calculations (3:2, 6:5 options)

### File Organization
- `/src/js/` - JavaScript modules
- `/src/css/` - Stylesheets
- `/src/assets/` - Card images and game assets
- Keep main entry point in `/src/main.js`

### Testing
- Test card counting accuracy
- Verify dealer H17 rule implementation
- Validate strategy recommendations

## Performance
- Optimize for smooth animations and transitions
- Minimize DOM updates during gameplay
- Use efficient state management for game logic
